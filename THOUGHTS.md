What things did you considered of during the implementation?
 I  set up a listener for incoming messages from the Azure Service Bus to catch banking transactions. Extracting key details like MessageType, AccountNumber, and Amount was crucial for accurate processing. I implemented logic to handle both Credit and Debit messages, ensuring that balances in the BankAccounts table are updated correctly. error management was done to prevent system crashes and facilitate troubleshooting.

Anything was unclear?
